# Catheter-survival
# Project Summary

## Team and Objectives

Our team embarked on a project to estimate the lifespan and influential factors of a medical device known as a catheter. The team comprised a physician, a guiding professor with expertise in Information Systems, and myself, serving as a programmer and researcher.

## Key Tasks Accomplished

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Initially, the data used for modeling underwent thorough cleansing and purification to enhance the accuracy of our analyses.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Various stages of data preprocessing, including normalization and standardization, were implemented to mitigate the effects of data diversity and undesirable impacts.

3. **Filling Missing Values using KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors):**
   - The KNN algorithm was employed to estimate and replace missing values, ensuring a more comprehensive dataset.

4. **Model Selection (Deep Learning):**
   - Briefly, deep learning methods were utilized for modeling to achieve higher precision.

## Results and Challenges

While our team devoted considerable effort, the achieved model accuracy of 51% fell below expectations. The team attributes this decrease in accuracy to insufficient data and the presence of missing values across various categories. These factors limit the model's ability to provide more precise predictions.

## Project Overview

In summary, our team endeavored to create a model for estimating the lifespan of catheters through data cleansing, preprocessing, missing value imputation, and the application of deep learning models. However, the model's accuracy was hindered by data limitations and missing values, indicating the need for further enhancements.
