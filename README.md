# Catheter-survival

## Project Summary

### Team and Objectives

Our team embarked on a project to estimate the lifespan and influential factors of a medical device known as a catheter. The team consisted of a dedicated physician, an accomplished professor specializing in Information Systems, and myself, contributing as a programmer and researcher.

### Key Accomplishments

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - We initiated the project by thoroughly cleansing and refining the dataset, a crucial step in enhancing the accuracy of our analyses.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Multiple stages of data preprocessing, including normalization and standardization, were executed to mitigate the impact of data diversity and undesirable anomalies.

3. **Filling Missing Values using KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors):**
   - Leveraging the KNN algorithm, we estimated and replaced missing values, ensuring a more robust and comprehensive dataset.

4. **Model Selection (Deep Learning):**
   - In brief, we employed deep learning techniques to achieve a higher level of precision in our modeling.

### Results and Challenges

Despite our team's unwavering efforts, the achieved model accuracy of 51% fell below our anticipated expectations. We attribute this decrease in accuracy to insufficient data and the prevalence of missing values across various categories. These factors impose limitations on the model's capacity to provide more accurate predictions.

### Project Overview

In summary, our team worked diligently to develop a model for estimating the lifespan of catheters. This involved a meticulous process of data cleansing, preprocessing, missing value imputation, and the application of deep learning models. However, the model's accuracy was impeded by data constraints and the presence of missing values, highlighting the need for further refinements.
